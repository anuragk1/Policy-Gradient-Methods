# Policy-Gradient-Methods
My implementations of some policy gradient algorithms
* All implementations are written in pytorch
* The algorithms are implemented as classes
* All implementations are encapsulated in a single file
* The algorithms take OpenAI gym envs and Pybullet envs as inputs

### Algorithms:
 - [x] Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)
 - [x] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
 - [x] Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
 - [x] Soft Actor Critic
 - [x] Proximal Policy Optimization
